.TH ypset 8 "May 1998" "YP Tools @VERSION@"
.SH NAME
ypset - bind ypbind to a particular NIS server
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B ypset
[
.BI \-d " domain"
]
[
.BI \-h " hostname"
]
.I server
.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
In  order  to run
.BR ypset,
.B ypbind
must be initiated with the
.B -ypset
or
.B -ypsetme
options.  See
.BR ypbind (8).
.B ypset
tells
.B ypbind
to get NIS services for the specified
.I domain
from the
.BR ypserv (8)
process running on
.IR server.
.LP
In cases where several hosts on the local net are supplying NIS services,
it is possible for
.B ypbind
to rebind to another host even while you attempt to find out if the
.B ypset
operation succeeded. For example, you can type:
.TP 25
.PD 0
.TP
\f3example% ypset host1
.TP
\f3example% ypwhich
.TP
\f3host2
.LP

which can be confusing. This is a function of the NIS subsystem's
attempt to know always a running NIS server, and occurs when host1
does not respond to ypbind because it is not running ypserv (or is
overloaded), and host2, running ypserv, gets the binding.
.LP

.I Server
indicates the NIS server to bind to,  and must be specified as a name
or an IP address. This will work only if the node has a current valid
binding for the domain in question, and
.B ypbind
has been set to allow use of
.BR ypset.
In most  cases,
.I server
should be specified as an IP address.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d " domain"
Specify a domain other than the default domain as returned by
.BR domainname (1).
.TP
.BI \-h " hostname"
Set the NIS binding on host
.hostname
 instead of the local machine.
